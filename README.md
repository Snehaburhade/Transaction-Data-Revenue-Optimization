Project Overview
Data is just noise until it tells a story. In this project, I took a deep dive into customer credit card behavior to uncover what actually drives revenue. By bridging the gap between raw demographics and spending habits, I developed a dual-dashboard system designed to help stakeholders optimize marketing spend, refine card offerings, and boost customer retention.

🔍 The Dataset & Preparation
The analysis is built on a comprehensive dataset covering customer profiles (income, education, location) and financial performance (transaction types, interest, and revenue).

The Cleanup (Excel)
Before any visualization, I treated the data in Microsoft Excel to ensure total accuracy:

De-duplication: Stripped out redundant records to prevent skewed metrics.

Data Integrity: Identified and filled gaps in the data using logical context-based mapping.

Standardization: Unified currency, dates, and numerical formats to ensure the dashboards reflect "one version of the truth."

📊 Phase 1: Transaction & Revenue Behavior
This stage focused on how the money moves. Key discoveries included:

The "Blue" Dominance: While luxury cards get the hype, the Blue Card is the workhorse, generating over 83% of total revenue ($55M).

Peak Cycles: Activity peaks in Q3, suggesting seasonal spending trends that marketing teams can capitalize on.

Swipe is King: Despite the rise of digital, 63.6% of transactions still happen via physical swipes, highlighting a traditional user base.

Top Triggers: "Bills" and "Entertainment" are the primary drivers of card usage, accounting for nearly 44% of all spending.

👥 Phase 2: Understanding the Customer
I shifted the focus to who is spending. This demographic breakdown revealed:

The Power Trio: New York, Texas, and California are the core engines of growth, contributing 22.7% of revenue.

The 40-50 Sweet Spot: This age group is the most profitable for interest-based income, representing a prime target for loan and credit products.

The High-Income Reliance: Currently, 100% of the $22M revenue in this segment comes from high-income earners—indicating a massive untapped market in the mid-to-low income brackets.

Family First: Married customers account for exactly half ($11M) of total revenue, underscoring the need for family-centric financial products.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations
Diversify the Portfolio: To reduce risk and expand the user base, the bank should launch entry-level cards for mid-and-low-income segments with controlled limits.

Reward the Professionals: Businessmen and White-collar workers drive over 58% of revenue. Targeted cashback on business expenses or professional networking perks would increase loyalty.

Monetize Interest: Since the 40–50 age group generates the most interest, we should prioritize them for Balance Transfer offers and Pre-approved Loans.

Family-Centric Perks: With married couples making up 50% of the revenue, introducing joint accounts or add-on cards for children could deepen customer "stickiness."
